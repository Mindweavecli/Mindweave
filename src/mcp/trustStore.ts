/**
 * trustStore.ts — where tool fingerprints live between sessions.
 *
 * Kept in the project's governor state dir, alongside `forbidden.md` and
 * `forbidden-commands.md`, because this is the same kind of thing: a persisted decision
 * about what this project is allowed to do, owned by the user rather than the model.
 *
 * Per PROJECT, not global. The same server can legitimately be a different build in two
 * checkouts, and a global record would make an ordinary version difference look like a
 * rug pull in every other project.
 *
 * Failure is always "no record": a missing or corrupt file means every tool reads as
 * fresh. That is the safe direction for availability (MCP keeps working) and the honest
 * one for security (we do not claim to have verified something we could not read).
