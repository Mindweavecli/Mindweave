/**
 * trust.test.ts — rug-pull detection, and being honest about its limits.
 *
 * The thing under test is narrow on purpose: we detect that a tool's description or
 * schema MOVED, not that it is bad. The tests below pin both halves — that a change is
 * caught, and that first sight is trusted — because the second is the limitation that
 * has to stay visible or the feature starts implying a guarantee it cannot make.
