/**
 * discover.ts — deciding, once per connection, which MCP a server actually speaks.
 *
 * 2026-07-28 added `server/discover`, a required RPC that reports a server's supported
 * protocol versions, capabilities and identity before any other call. That is the happy
 * path. The problem is everything else: the overwhelming majority of servers deployed
 * today predate the revision, have never heard of the method, and expect the
 * `initialize` handshake that 2026-07-28 deleted.
 *
 * So connecting is a PROBE, not an assumption:
 *
 *   1. Call `server/discover`. If it answers, take the newest version we both know
 *      and speak that dialect.
 *   2. If it comes back "method not found", that IS the compatibility signal — the
 *      server is pre-stateless. Fall back to `initialize`, and speak whatever version
 *      it reports back.
 *   3. If neither works, the server is not usable; the pool records it as failed and
 *      the session carries on without it.
 *
 * The decision itself (`negotiate`) is a pure function over two version lists, so the
 * whole matrix is unit-tested rather than discovered against live servers. Only the
 * probe does I/O.
